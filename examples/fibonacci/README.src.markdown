[OOC: this directory is pretending to be a Python package that provides Fibonacci-related functions. But it's really an example of what a simple `testref`-using project might look like.]

Utilities for Fibonacci-related stuff.

(A note on indexing: the `fib` function, starting at `n=0`, goes `1, 1, 2, 3, ...` ![](test:~test_zero_indexed_goes_1_1_2_3))
